This project is a learning exercise from Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course: [The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/?couponCode=CP251118G4). It focuses on mastering modern React development practices with emphasis on React Router, Redux, and Tailwind CSS.

**Disclaimer:** This is purely an educational project. No claims are made on the original design or concept—all credit goes to the course instructor. The goal is to strengthen my skills in React and its ecosystem to become a better full-stack developer.

## Project Goals
