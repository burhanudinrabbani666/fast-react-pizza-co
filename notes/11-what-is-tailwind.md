# What is Tailwind css

- 👉 “A utility-first CSS framework packed with utility classes like flex, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup HTML or JSX ”
- 👉 Utility-first CSS approach: writing tiny classes with one single purpose, and then combining them to build entire layouts
- 👉 In tailwind, these classes are already written for us. So we’re not gonna write any new CSS, but instead use some of tailwind’s hundreds of classes

## The Good

- You don’t need to think about class names
- No jumping between files to write markup and styles
- Immediately understand styling in any project that uses tailwind
- Tailwind is a design system: many design decisions have been taken for you, which makes UIs look better and more consistent
- Saves a lot of time, e.g. on responsive design
- Docs and VS Code integration are great

## The Bad

- 👎 Markup HTML or JSX looks very unreadable, with lots of class names (you get used to it)
- 👎 You have to learn a lot of class names (but after a day of usage you know fundamentals)
- 👎 You need to install and set up tailwind on each new project
- 👎 You’re giving up on “vanilla CSS” 😢
